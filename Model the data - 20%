## üß© **Power BI ‚Äì ‚ÄúModel the Data‚Äù Questions and Answers (1‚Äì40)**

---

### **1. What is a data model in Power BI?**

**Answer:** A **data model** organizes data into tables and relationships that Power BI uses for calculations and visualizations.

---

### **2. What is a star schema in Power BI?**

**Answer:** A **star schema** consists of **one central fact table** connected to multiple **dimension tables**.

---

### **3. Why is a star schema preferred over a snowflake schema?**

**Answer:** It provides **simpler relationships**, **faster queries**, and **better performance** in Power BI.

---

### **4. What types of relationships exist in Power BI?**

**Answer:**

* One-to-Many (1:*),
* Many-to-One (*:1),
* One-to-One (1:1),
* Many-to-Many (*:*).

---

### **5. What is cardinality in Power BI relationships?**

**Answer:** Cardinality defines the **uniqueness** between related tables (e.g., one-to-many).

---

### **6. What is cross-filter direction in Power BI?**

**Answer:** It determines **how filters flow** between related tables ‚Äî either **Single** or **Both** directions.

---

### **7. How can you create a relationship manually in Power BI?**

**Answer:** Use **Model View ‚Üí Manage Relationships ‚Üí New**, then select tables and key columns.

---

### **8. What is an inactive relationship in Power BI?**

**Answer:** A relationship not used by default but can be **activated using USERELATIONSHIP()** in DAX.

---

### **9. What is the purpose of the RELATED function?**

**Answer:** Retrieves a related column value from another table based on an existing relationship.

---

### **10. What does the RELATEDTABLE function do?**

**Answer:** Returns a table of related rows from another table using an active relationship.

---

### **11. What is a calculated column in Power BI?**

**Answer:** A new column created using a **DAX formula**, stored in the model for each row.

---

### **12. What is a measure in Power BI?**

**Answer:** A **dynamic calculation** created using DAX that aggregates data at query time.

---

### **13. What is the difference between a calculated column and a measure?**

**Answer:**

* Calculated column ‚Üí Stored in model, increases size.
* Measure ‚Üí Calculated on demand, uses less memory.

---

### **14. What is a hierarchy in Power BI?**

**Answer:** A logical structure combining related fields (e.g., Year ‚Üí Quarter ‚Üí Month ‚Üí Day).

---

### **15. What is the function of the SUMX DAX function?**

**Answer:** Iterates over a table and sums the result of an expression for each row.

---

### **16. What does the CALCULATE DAX function do?**

**Answer:** Changes the filter context and evaluates an expression in that modified context.

---

### **17. What is row context in DAX?**

**Answer:** The **current row being evaluated** in a table or iteration function.

---

### **18. What is filter context in DAX?**

**Answer:** The set of filters applied to evaluate a measure or visual in Power BI.

---

### **19. What is context transition in DAX?**

**Answer:** When a **row context is converted into a filter context**, typically by CALCULATE.

---

### **20. What is the difference between ALL and ALLEXCEPT in DAX?**

**Answer:**

* **ALL:** Removes all filters.
* **ALLEXCEPT:** Removes all filters except specified columns.

---

### **21. What is the purpose of the VALUES function?**

**Answer:** Returns a **one-column table of distinct values** from a specified column.

---

### **22. What is the DISTINCTCOUNT function used for?**

**Answer:** Counts the **number of unique values** in a column.

---

### **23. What does the DIVIDE DAX function do?**

**Answer:** Safely divides two numbers and handles division by zero with an optional alternate result.

---

### **24. What is a many-to-many relationship?**

**Answer:** When both tables contain duplicate values in the key column, requiring a **bridge table** or **bidirectional filtering**.

---

### **25. What is a composite model in Power BI?**

**Answer:** A model that supports both **Import** and **DirectQuery** connections in the same dataset.

---

### **26. What is the role of the ‚ÄúAssume Referential Integrity‚Äù setting in DirectQuery?**

**Answer:** Enables **inner joins** for faster query performance when data integrity is guaranteed.

---

### **27. What is the purpose of role-playing dimensions?**

**Answer:** To reuse a single dimension (e.g., Date) multiple times in a model for different relationships (e.g., Order Date, Ship Date).

---

### **28. What DAX function is used to handle blanks in calculations?**

**Answer:** **COALESCE()** or **IF(ISBLANK())**.

---

### **29. How can you calculate a running total in DAX?**

**Answer:** Use **CALCULATE([Measure], FILTER(ALL(Date), Date <= MAX(Date)))**.

---

### **30. What is DAX Studio used for?**

**Answer:** To **analyze, debug, and optimize DAX queries** and measure performance.

---

### **31. What is Row-Level Security (RLS)?**

**Answer:** A method to restrict user access to data rows based on **roles and filters**.

---

### **32. What are dynamic RLS roles?**

**Answer:** Roles that filter data based on the **logged-in user‚Äôs identity** using **USERPRINCIPALNAME()**.

---

### **33. What are calculated tables in Power BI?**

**Answer:** Tables created using DAX expressions that generate new data sets within the model.

---

### **34. What is the purpose of the SUMMARIZE function in DAX?**

**Answer:** Groups data by specified columns and allows custom aggregations.

---

### **35. What is model optimization in Power BI?**

**Answer:** Reducing model size and improving speed by removing unused columns, using star schema, and replacing calculated columns with measures.

---

### **36. How can you reduce model size?**

**Answer:**

* Use numeric keys.
* Disable auto date/time.
* Avoid high-cardinality columns.

---

### **37. What is the purpose of bidirectional filtering?**

**Answer:** Allows filters to propagate both ways between related tables for complex relationships.

---

### **38. What is an inactive relationship used for?**

**Answer:** To handle **multiple possible relationships** between two tables, activated only when required.

---

### **39. What is a surrogate key?**

**Answer:** A **unique identifier** (usually numeric) used as the primary key in a dimension table.

---

### **40. Why is normalization avoided in Power BI data models?**

**Answer:** Because **denormalized (flat) structures** with fewer joins improve report performance and usability.
